🧠 What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI = Autonomous AI workers
They don’t just respond — they act.

✔ They understand goals

✔ Break tasks into steps
✔ Share information
✔ Collaborate
✔ Produce polished results

Agents behave like intelligent teammates instead of passive chatbots.

👥 Agents
🧠 Researcher Agent

🔎 “The Analytical Thinker”

Gathers reliable information

Breaks down complex topics

Identifies key insights

Produces structured findings

✍️ Writer Agent

📝 “The Communication Expert”

Converts research into clear, readable content

Ensures flow, clarity, and tone

Creates polished summaries and articles

📌 Tasks
Task	Assigned Agent	Description
🔍 Research Task	Researcher	Investigates a topic and extracts key points.
✍️ Writing Task	Writer	Produces a well-structured summary based on research.

Each task has:

A description

An expected output

An assigned agent

All stored in YAML for easy editing.
